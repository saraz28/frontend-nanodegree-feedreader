In this project indicates how to write tests against it using jasmine's testing syntax.

## feedreader.js
1. Loops through each feed in the _allFeeds_ object and ensures it has a URL and name defined and both of them not empty.
2. A test that ensures the menu element is hidden by default and it changes visibility when the menu icon is clicked.
3. A test that ensures when the loadFeed function is called and completes its work, there is at least a single _entry_ element within the _feed_ container.
4. A test that ensures when a new feed is loaded by the loadFeed function that the content actually changes.
